# BazaarMarket
*by vyketype*

### **Recreation of the Hypixel Skyblock Bazaar system, but fully customizable.**

**Requires Spigot 1.20**

Currently, the project is in the works, but most functionality is added. See 1.0-pre1 [here](https://github.com/vyketype/BazaarMarket/releases/tag/1.0-pre1).

**TODOs** <u>BEFORE 1.0 RELEASE</u>
* Add /pay, which will allow players to directly give money to others;
* Integrate profile balances with Vault;
* Add a custom toggleable economy API in case Vault is not detected;
* Fix issue where plugin does not load correctly on first time.

Full documentation will be released when 1.0 is released, which will be probably during September 2023. For now, just run `/market` or `/m` and go from there. Create a buy order and wait for someone to match it with a sell order, or vice versa. Note that all orders are [limit orders](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/how-stock-markets-work/types-orders#:~:text=A%20limit%20order%20is%20an,for%20no%20more%20than%20%2410.).
